- Explore different algorithms and data structures

## Project Structure 

.
├── utils/
│ └── read-input.mjs # Utility functions for reading input files
├── [YEAR]/ # Solutions organized by year
│ ├── [DAY]/ # Solutions for each day
│ │ ├── solve.mjs # Solution implementation
│ │ ├── input.txt # Puzzle input

## Running Solutions

Each day's solution is a standalone JavaScript module that can be run using Node.js. To run a solution:

```bash
node [YEAR]/[DAY]/solve.mjs
```

This will execute the solution and print the results to the console.
